# Responsive Web Design

> -   ♫ Responsive web design is essentially a technique that we can use to make a webpage adjust its layout and its visual style to any possible screen size(window or viewport size).
> -   ♫ So no matter if you're using desktop computers, tablets, or a mobile phone, a responsive website will be easily consumable on all of these devices.
> -   ♫ It’s a set of practices, not a separate technology. It’s all just CSS!
> -   ♫ There are essentially four big ingredients to responsive designs, and those are fluid layouts, responsive units, flexible images, and media queries.
